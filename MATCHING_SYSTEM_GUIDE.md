# 🎯 Matching System Guide

## Overview

Your app now has a complete matching system with:
- ✅ Real-time profile loading from Firestore
- ✅ Swipe functionality (left = pass, right = connect)
- ✅ Automatic match detection when both users swipe right
- ✅ Messaging capability for matched users
- ✅ Data persistence in Firestore

---

## 🔥 How It Works

### 1. **User Flow**

1. **Signup** → User fills out profile with photo
2. **Waiting for Approval** → User sees waiting screen
3. **Admin Reviews** → You approve/reject via admin dashboard
4. **Matching** → Approved users can see and swipe on other approved users
5. **Match Created** → When both users swipe right, a match is created
6. **Messaging** → Matched users can message each other

### 2. **Database Collections**

#### `users` Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "user123",
  name: "john doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  role: "technical" | "non-technical",
  skills: ["react", "node.js"],
  bio: "...",
  passions: "...",
  experience: "...",
  currentProject: "...",
  lookingFor: "...",
  profileImageUrl: "https://...",
  approved: false,  // Changed to true when admin approves
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### `swipes` Collection
Tracks every swipe action:
```javascript
{
  fromUserId: "user123",
  toUserId: "user456",
  direction: "left" | "right",
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

#### `matches` Collection
Created when BOTH users swipe right on each other:
```javascript
{
  user1Id: "user123",
  user2Id: "user456",
  conversationId: "user123_user456",
  status: "active",
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

#### `messages` Collection
Stores all messages between users:
```javascript
{
  fromUserId: "user123",
  toUserId: "user456",
  message: "Hey! Let's build together!",
  timestamp: timestamp,
  read: false
}
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Update Firestore Rules

**YOU MUST UPDATE YOUR FIRESTORE RULES IN FIREBASE CONSOLE!**

Go to: **Firebase Console** → **Firestore Database** → **Rules**

Copy and paste these rules (from `FIRESTORE_RULES.txt`):

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Users collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read: if resource.data.approved == true;
      allow update, delete: if true; // ⚠️ TODO: Add admin auth
    }
    
    // Matches collection
    match /matches/{matchId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Messages collection
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Swipes collection
    match /swipes/{swipeId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Click "Publish"** to save the rules.

## ✅ Testing the System

### Test the Admin Dashboard:

1. Go to `cofndrly.com/admin`
2. Login with: `admin` / `cofndrly2025`
3. You should see all user applications
4. Click on a user to view their full profile
5. Click "Approve" to make them visible in the matching system
6. Click "Reject" to delete their application

### Test the Matching Page:

1. Go to `cofndrly.com/matching` (or add a link from your landing page)
2. You should see approved users' profiles
3. Swipe left to pass, swipe right to connect
4. If both users swipe right, you'll see "🎉 It's a match!"
5. Matches are stored in the `matches` collection

## 🔧 Current Limitations & Next Steps

### Current State:
- ✅ Matching system works
- ✅ Swipes are recorded
- ✅ Matches are detected automatically
- ✅ Messages can be sent
- ⚠️ **No user authentication yet** (using demo user ID)
- ⚠️ **No message inbox UI** (messages stored but no view)
- ⚠️ **Admin is open to anyone** (needs proper auth)

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Add Firebase Authentication**
   - Allow users to login after approval
   - Track which user is currently logged in
   - Replace `demo-user-123` with real user IDs

2. **Build Message Inbox**
   - Show all matches for current user
   - Display conversations with matched users
   - Real-time message updates

3. **Secure Admin Panel**
   - Add proper admin authentication
   - Use Firebase Auth custom claims for admin role
   - Update Firestore rules to check for admin

4. **Add Notifications**
   - Email when approved
   - Email when matched
   - In-app notifications for new messages

## 📊 Monitoring Your Data

### View your data in Firebase Console:

1. **Firestore Database** → Collections
2. Check these collections:
   - `users` - All user profiles
   - `swipes` - All swipe actions
   - `matches` - All successful matches
   - `messages` - All messages sent

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Error approving user" in admin dashboard:
- **Cause**: Firestore rules blocking writes
- **Fix**: Update Firestore rules (see above)

### "No profiles yet" in matching page:
- **Cause**: No approved users in database
- **Fix**: Approve some users via admin dashboard

### "Error recording swipe":
- **Cause**: Firestore rules blocking writes to `swipes` collection
- **Fix**: Update Firestore rules to allow create on swipes

### Match not detected:
- **Cause**: Either rules blocking or swipes not recorded properly
- **Fix**: Check Firestore console → swipes collection to verify swipes are being saved

## 💡 Tips

- Always test with at least 2 approved users to see the matching work
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Monitor Firestore usage in Firebase Console (you have free tier limits)
- Consider adding indexes if queries are slow (Firebase will suggest them)
